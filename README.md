A game based on Shazam's principe - guessing the song by singing, humming or lyrics.

# How to play

After opening the app, press "New game" button (in the header) to start a new game. You can see your and PC's scores in the header.

Then you can press the microphone button to start recording the song (press again to stop recording). After the song was recorded, you can press "Song" or "Humming" buttons to start guessing. Or, you can enter lyrics in the text field and press "Submit" button.

If the app couldn't recognize your song, you'll see the window with error. Otherwise, you'll see the window asking you whether PC is right or wrong.

At the end of the game, you'll see the window with the winner, right answer and the songs offered.
